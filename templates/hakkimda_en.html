  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; color: #ddd; margin-top: 10px; font-weight: 500;">
    I'm İsmail Efe Yalçınkaya, a passionate and driven Computer Engineering student at Yeditepe University.
    <br><br>
    My disciplined lifestyle is shaped by my background in professional swimming — I was a national swimmer for Galatasaray Sports Club and the Turkish National Team, earning numerous medals in both national and international championships.
    <br><br>
    Academically, I’ve studied Python, C, Java, and Verilog. Additionally, I independently learned web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance my development skills.
    <br><br>
    I'm continuously expanding my expertise in software development, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. With a focus on user-centered, sustainable, and secure solutions, I aim to make a meaningful contribution to the industry — driven by my passion for learning and the power of teamwork.
